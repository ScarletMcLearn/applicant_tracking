                            An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software application that enables the electronic 
                            handling of recruitment needs. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online on an enterprise
                            or small business level, depending on the needs of the company and there is also free and open 
                            source ATS software available. An ATS is very similar to customer relationship management (CRM) systems,
                            but are designed for recruitment tracking purposes. In many cases they filter applications automatically 
                            based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended.
                        This has caused many to adapt resume optimization techniques similar to those used in search engine
                            optimization when creating and formatting their resume.
